Step 1:
SummarizeZonalData.R = extracts the data from the rasters

Step 2: 
DataSummary.R = formats the extracted data by converting raw data to zero to 1 based on reference points (typically max eez values)

We are currently (Feb 25, 2015) exploring setting the reference point at the raster scale (rather than eez scale)

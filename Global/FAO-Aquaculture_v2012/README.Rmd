For OHI 2015, redo Mariculture reference point:::

'A global assessment of offshore mariculture potential from a spatial perspective'
http://www.fao.org/docrep/017/i3100e/i3100e.pdf

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

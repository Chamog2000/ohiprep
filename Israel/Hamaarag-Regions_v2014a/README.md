# Israel Hamaarag-Regions_v2014a

Regions were generated with inland and offshore buffers as shapefiles and csv data files that are used in the Ocean Health Index by [model.py](./model.py) in ArcGIS 10.2:
- offshore1km ([csv](./data/rgn_offshore1km_data.csv))
- offshore3nm ([csv](./data/rgn_offshore3nm_data.csv))
- inland1km ([csv](./data/rgn_inland1km_data.csv))
- inland25km ([csv](./data/rgn_inland25km_data.csv))
- inland50km ([csv](./data/rgn_inland50km_data.csv))

## Issues
- smaller study area? missing southern coast?
- inland50km lower right
- inland25km non-existent

## Toolbox

The format compatible for visulation in the [Isreal OHI toolbox](https://github.com/bbest/ohi-israel) was also generated by [digest.R](./digest.R): data/regions.gcs.js.  This was based on a smoothed shapefile which is also handy for quickly generating maps in R.

The Sea Level Rise pressure layer was updated with new data for the year 2013. Previous data went through 2012.  


###Data
  
Data for mean sea level rise (in mm) between January 1993 and June 2014 was downloaded on 1/12/15 from [AVISO](http://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/en/data/products/ocean-indicators-products/mean-sea-level/products-images.html).


####Set reference point

The reference point was set by looking at the distribution of values in the data and choosing an appropriate value to set as 1.


The 99.99th percentile (24.0321697) was chosen as the reference point with a 10% buffer for an actual reference point of **26.43539**. After normalizing data by this value, all values greater than 1 were set equal to 1.

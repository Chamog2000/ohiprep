Ocean Acidification,2011-2015,Aragonite saturation state,Threshold and change,N/A,<=1,NA,NA,aragonite saturation state,"An aragonite saturation state less than or equal to 1 is widely recognized as undersaturated and can be attributed as a threshold for acidification globally. For regions that are greater than 1, values are rescaled according to their amount of change compared to historical values"
Sea Level Rise,1993-2015,Mean Sea Level Anomaly (MSLA) as compared to a 20 year mean (meters),99.99 quantile across full time range,N/A,0.2523,-0.93985,0.51,meters,Annual means are aggregated from monthly data. No need for a historical comparison since the data comes computed against a 20 year mean.
Ultraviolet Radiation Anomalies,2005 - 2015,Number of positive anomalies compared to historical reference,99.99 quantile,N/A,41,0,2.353562,number of anomalous weeks in a year,Reference point is the 99.99th quantile of the differences in anomalies between historical and recent years
Sea Surface Temperature,1982 - 2012,"Number of positive anomalies (weekly data from 1982-2012), defined as number >1sd from historical mean (1985-1989)",99.99 quantile across full time range,N/A,128,-133,164,number of anomalous weeks in 5 yr period,historical data was selected to avoid el nino years
Marine Plastics,N/A,Weight of plastics in ocean (g/km2),99.99 quantile,N/A,11.75089,0.2620125,13.2109,g/km2,Reference point is log value (entire layer log transformed before rescaled)
Commercial fishing (high bycatch),2003 - 2010,Catch (tons per km2) standardized by primary productivity,99.99 quantile across full time range,N/A,10.28,0,11.32801,tons per km2 standardized by primary productivity,Reference point is log value (entire layer log transformed before rescaled)
Commercial fishing (low bycatch),2003 - 2010,Catch (tons per km2) standardized by primary productivity,99.99 quantile across full time range,N/A,11.2,0,12.32698,tons per km2 standardized by primary productivity,Reference point is log value (entire layer log transformed before rescaled)
Artisanal fishing,2003 - 2010,Catch (tons per km2) standardized by primary productivity,99.99 quantile across full time range,,11.38,0,11.73944,tons per km2 standardized by primary productivity,Reference point is log value (entire layer log transformed before rescaled)
Fertilizer plume data,2007-2012,Modeled FAO fertilizer data based on land-use data,99.99 quantile,2011,5.59,,,,Reference point is log value (entire layer log transformed before rescaled)
Pesticide plume data,2007-2012,Modeled FAO pesticide data based on land-use data,99.99 quantile,2012,1.92,,,,Reference point is log value (entire layer log transformed before rescaled)

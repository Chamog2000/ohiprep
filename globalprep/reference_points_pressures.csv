Ocean Acidification,2011-2015,N/A,Aragonite saturation state,Threshold and change,N/A,<=1,"An aragonite saturation state less than or equal to 1 is widely recognized as undersaturated and can be attributed as a threshold for acidification globally. For regions that are greater than 1, values are rescaled according to their amount of change compared to historical values"
Sea Level Rise,1993-2015, -0.93985 to 0.51,Mean Sea Level Anomaly (MSLA) as compared to a 20 year mean (meters),99.99 quantile across full time range,N/A,0.2523,Annual means are aggregated from monthly data. No need for a historical comparison since the data comes computed against a 20 year mean.
Ultraviolet Radiation Anomalies,2005 - 2015,0 to 2.353562,Number of positive anomalies compared to historical reference,99.99 quantile,N/A,2.259725,Reference point is log value (entire layer log transformed before rescaled)
Sea Surface Temperature,1982 - 2012,,"Number of positive anomalies (weekly data from 1982-2012), defined as number >1sd from historical mean (1985-1989)",99.99 quantile,2013,133.0371,historical data was selected to avoid el nino years
Marine Plastics,N/A,"raw: 0.2995428, 546285.2 log: 0.2620125, 13.2109 ",Weight of plastics in ocean (g/km2),99.99 quantile,N/A,11.75089,Reference point is log value (entire layer log transformed before rescaled)
Commercial fishing (high bycatch),2006-2010,"raw: 0 to 5.83246 tons/km2 standardized by npplog: 0 to 1.921685",Catch (tons per km2) standardized by primary productivity,99.99 quantile,N/A,1.747792,Reference point is log value (entire layer log transformed before rescaled)
Commercial fishing (low bycatch),2006-2010,"raw: 0 to 3.003751 tons/km2 standardized by npplog: 0 to 1.387",Catch (tons per km2) standardized by primary productivity,99.99 quantile,N/A,1.361444,Reference point is log value (entire layer log transformed before rescaled)
Artisanal fishing,2003 - 2010,,,99.99 quantile across full time range,,11.38,
Fertilizer plume data,2007-2012,,Modeled FAO fertilizer data based on land-use data,99.99 quantile,2011,5.59,Reference point is log value (entire layer log transformed before rescaled)
Pesticide plume data,2007-2012,,Modeled FAO pesticide data based on land-use data,99.99 quantile,2012,1.92,Reference point is log value (entire layer log transformed before rescaled)

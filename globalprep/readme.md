# The **NEW** organized Global

This directory will have all the scripts and data outputs after Jan 29 2015 with a new method of organization.  

We realized that it would be better if each directory contained the folders with the years the data was downloaded: 

globalprep/WDPA-MPA/2015
globalprep/WDPA-MPA/2016

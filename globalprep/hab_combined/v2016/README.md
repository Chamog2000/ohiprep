### Combining the habitat data for extent, health, and trend.

Unfortunately, most habitat data is difficult to find at the global scale and consequently isn't updated as frequently as it should be.

#### Summary of last updates for each habitat and dimension

Habitat | Extent  | Health  | Trend
-------- | ------- | -------- |-------------
Coral    | 2012    | 2012      | 2012
Mangrove | 2015    | 2012      | 2015

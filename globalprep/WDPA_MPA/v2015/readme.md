# LSP notes

The original data and additional tmp files are located on Neptune:
N:\git-annex\globalprep\WDPA_MPA\v2015

model.py: uses ArcGIS to convert WDPA-MPA data to a raster and then extracts data for 1km inland and 3nm offshore. More information about the .py script is found in teh README_dataDescription.html (in the v2014_archive folder)

digest.R: prepares the final data for the Toolbox.

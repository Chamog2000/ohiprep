# sequence:
#   use model.py to rasterize WDPA polygons and output .dbfs
#     use python just to generate rasters, and move raster analysis over to R script?
#     call python script from top-level R script using rPython?
#       if so, can we pass variables to it, e.g. file locations for a new analysis?
#   use digest.R to crunch .dbfs into total areas per region per year

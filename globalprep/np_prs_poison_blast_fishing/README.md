### The information in v2013 was moved from: ohiprep/Global/WRI-ReefsAtRisk_v2013

Originally, this script only focused on preparing data for the natural products goal. But, I am trying to organize these data, so now it houses the pressure data as well (habitat destruction subtidal hard bottom and food provision artisanal high bycatch)

### The raw data files are now on Mazu: git-annex/globalprep/_raw_data  (these reference the d2013 data)

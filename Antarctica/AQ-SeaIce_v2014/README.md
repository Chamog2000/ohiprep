## Sea Ice data 

corresponding tmp and raw data files are located here (on Neptune due to their large size):  
  Neptune: model/GL-AQ-SeaIce_v2014/SampleSeaIce

Latest sea ice data is not based on the NSIDC data (although, I will keep here as a reference and because it might be useful for generating "extent" data).

New data is based on Sea Ice Season (days)

I received these data from: jrheuban@whoi.edu  (Jennie Rheuban) and sdoney@whoi.edu (Scott Doney)
